      <p>
        It is sometimes best to practice
        building a markdown file in an offline program like <a href="http://25.io/mou/">Mou</a>
        or an online one like <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dilliger</a> before you post it online.

      <!-- This section walks through steps for making a contribution markdown file for a code repo, it's just an example of what you might do with your exercise or your walk through time, though you're also welcome to just list some notes or links to guide your session -->
      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Reflect / Plan</h1>
          <p>
            Start by reflecting on what to include, and what to invite (in terms of contributions)
            in your CONTRIBUTING.md.  See an <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">
            example of the Atom.io CONTRIBUTING.md file</a>.  Consider adding the following elements
            to your file.
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Welcome contributors to the project</strong>: Admit that you
              are eager for contributions and so happy they found themselves here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Table of Contents</strong>:
                If your CONTRIBUTING.md file is long, you might consider including a table
                of contents with links to different headings in your document. In github,
                each heading is given a URL by default, so you can link to that URL in the
                appropriate section of the Table of Contents for each heading. Do this in
                Markdown by wrapping the heading in [ ] and following with a parenthetical
                that includes the URL or header after # like <code>[Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Short Links to Important Resources</strong>:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>docs</strong>: handbook / roadmap (you'll learn more about this in
              the roadmapping session)<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>bugs</strong>: issue tracker / bug report tool<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>comms</strong>: forum link, developer list, IRC/email<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Testing</strong>: how to test the project, where the tests are
              located in your directories.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Environment details</strong>: how to set up your development
              environment.  This might exist in the README.md depending on the project.
              If so, include a link.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How to submit changes</strong>: Pull Request protocol etc. You
              might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission,
              or any caveats about the speed of response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How to report a bug</strong>: Bugs are problems in code, in the
              functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them
              through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that
              they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor.
              Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs">
              Atom's example</a> for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Templates</strong>: in this section of your file, you might also
              want to link to a bug report "template" like this one
              <a href="https://gist.github.com/auremoser/72803ba969d0e61ff070">here</a>
              which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs
              tidy and relevant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>First bugs for Contributors</strong>: Sometimes it is helpful to
              provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle
              (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them), see Atom's
              example section <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How to request an "enhancement"</strong> - enhancements are features that
              you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with
              the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues
              (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby
              allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project.
              See <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-enhancements">Atom's
              example section</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Style Guide / Coding conventions</strong> -
              <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides">See Atom's example</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> - You can make this part of CONTRIBUTING.md as
              <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct">Atom did</a> to
              set the tone for contributions.  You can also make this a separate Markdown file
              and link to it in CONTRIBUTING.md.  You can also extend this section to link to your
              LICENSE.md or any details for project consumers on permissions and license details you
              have established for building on your work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recognition model</strong> - provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for
              contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for
              participating in your project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Who is involved?</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md</a>
              has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual
              to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core
              contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a
              <a href="http://humanstxt.org/">humans.txt</a> file in your root directory (same
              place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here
              is an <a href="http://www.stereosemantics.com/humans.txt">example of a humans.txt file</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Where can I ask for help?</strong> - a nice extension to the previous section,
              with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file</h1>
          <!-- <time>3 minutes each</time> -->
          <p>
            Start by making the structure of your project clean and welcoming, with folder titles that
            make sense, if you have several projects, consider adopting a template "project structure"
            that is consistent across projects, take a look at this <a href="https://github.com/CODESIGN2/Project-Structure">example</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Author a CONTRIBUTING.md file that fits your projects. Check out the models below in "Followup
            Resources" and incorporate the appropriate "To Include" items above.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Make Supporting Materials</h1>
          <!-- <time>30 minutes</time> -->
          <p>
            <strong>Make a LICENSE</strong>: Make a LICENSE.md file that you can reference in your CONTRIBUTING.md file,
            use the following links to generate and copy the appropriate text:
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">https://creativecommons.org/choose/</a><br />
            <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">http://choosealicense.com/</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Make a README</strong> - make a README.md with a brief description of your project and some
            setup/installation details that you might link to in your CONTRIBUTING.md file.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Create a system for rewarding people</strong><br />
            (OPTIONAL) Include a humans.txt file to give accolades to contributors.
            Store this in your root directory just like your CONTRIBUTING.md.  On deployment,
            it will be available via your website at <em>www.YOURWEBSITE.com/humans.txt</em>.<br />
            <br />(OPTIONAL) <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">Get a DOI</a> for
            a your project and make <a href="https://mozillascience.org/projects/contributorship-badges">Contributor
            Badges</a> as a way to recognize contributors for their particular contributions.<br />
            <br />Hat-tip or thank people in your README.md, especially if you forked their repo.  Thank
            people when they submit issues or requests; be polite.
